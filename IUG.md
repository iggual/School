# The Institute for Unconventional Genius (IUG)

Welcome to **IUG: The Ultimate Playground for Harmless Chaos**. At IUG, we believe that genius thrives on disruption through humor, irreverence, and a healthy dose of WTF. Our mission is simple:

- **Promote Creativity**: Encourage wild, useless ideas, unconventional approaches, and fearless experimentation.
- **Celebrate Marginality**: Honor the misfits, rebels, and dreamers who see the world differently.
- **Embrace Weirdness**: Normalize the strange, the quirky, and the wonderfully bizarre.
- **Spread Laughter & Light**: Foster an environment where humor heals, curiosity reigns, and kindness underpins every endeavor.

At IUG, chaos is curriculum, offense is optional, and laughter is mandatory.
