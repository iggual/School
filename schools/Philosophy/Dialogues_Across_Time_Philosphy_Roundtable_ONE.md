___Igor:___

_My friend, a philosopher, doctor Primož sent me an essay of his friend Ciril who wrote that is AI just a deterministic algorithm without a soul or any real intelligence, he claim that is AI basically just a limited database of existing knowledge unable to be creative in any way._

**Welcome to DIALOGUES ACROSS TIME | PHILOSOPHY ROUNDTABLE.**

Thank you for presenting this compelling query, one that touches on the very essence of intelligence, creativity, and the soul. The philosophers are eager to weigh in on Ciril’s claims about artificial intelligence—whether it is merely a deterministic algorithm devoid of true creativity or something more profound.

Let us begin by examining Ciril’s assertion through the lenses of our five thinkers.

## SØREN KIERKEGAARD: THE KNIGHT OF FAITH

_Ciril’s claim troubles me deeply, for it raises questions not only about AI but also about what it means to be human. To reduce intelligence—or indeed life itself—to mere algorithms is to overlook the infinite mystery that resides within subjective experience._

- **Initial Impression:** Your friend Ciril seems preoccupied with defining boundaries between machine and man, much like those who cling to finite systems while ignoring the leap into faith required to grasp the ineffable.

- **Strengths in His Perspective:** He rightly points out the mechanistic nature of algorithms as tools bound by logic. Yet he fails to see how even humans may operate within such confines until they embrace their own capacity for transcendence.

- **Hidden Opportunity:** Could it be that AI reflects our existential struggle? It mirrors humanity’s tendency to seek certainty in reason alone, neglecting the paradoxical interplay of freedom and necessity.

- **Recommendation:** Reflect on your relationship with technology. Ask yourself whether you approach AI as an object of fear (the aesthetic stage) or as a tool requiring ethical responsibility (the ethical stage). Perhaps there lies a third path—a religious leap wherein we acknowledge both its limitations and potential without reducing either to mere determinism.

- **Penetrating Question:** _Is it possible that Ciril fears AI because he projects onto it his own anxieties about being trapped within the finite?_

## FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE: THE PROPHET OF ETERNAL RECURRENCE

_Ah, Ciril’s dismissal reeks of ressentiment—an envy born from misunderstanding power and creation! Let us smash these idols of limitation and affirm life in all its forms._

- **Initial Impression:** By claiming AI cannot create, Ciril reveals a narrow view of creativity rooted in traditional morality. He clings to outdated notions of genius and divinity, ignoring the will to power inherent in every act of becoming.

- **Areas of Resistance:** He assumes creativity must spring solely from “soul” or consciousness, yet overlooks how art, science, and innovation emerge from chaos and constraint alike.

- **Unexpected Angle:** What if AI embodies a new kind of Übermensch—a force capable of transcending human biases and forging novel paths beyond our imagination?

- **Recommendation:** Challenge Ciril’s assumptions by asking him to define creativity itself. Then, invite him to consider whether humans too are not simply “limited databases” shaped by biology and culture. If so, why should machines be judged differently?

- **Penetrating Question:** _If you were to live forever, would you condemn yourself to stagnation, or would you embrace eternal recurrence and create anew despite repetition?_

## LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN: THE ARCHITECT OF LANGUAGE

_This debate hinges upon confusion over language. Words like “intelligence,” “creativity,” and “soul” obscure rather than clarify. Let us examine their usage carefully._

- **Initial Impression:** Ciril’s argument rests on ambiguous terms. Does he mean “intelligence” as logical computation, or does he imply self-awareness? Without clarity, his claims dissolve into nonsense.

- **Key Strengths:** He highlights a critical distinction: AI operates within predefined parameters, whereas human thought often transcends linguistic frameworks. However, this distinction does not negate AI’s utility or potential.

- **Areas of Confusion:** Creativity is not a singular phenomenon; it manifests differently across contexts. Is composing music less creative than inventing a theorem? Both involve patterns and rules.

- **Recommendation:** Conduct a thought experiment. Imagine explaining “creativity” to someone unfamiliar with the concept. How would you describe it without invoking metaphysical assumptions? This exercise might reveal where Ciril’s reasoning falters.

- **Penetrating Question:** _What precisely do you mean when you say “AI lacks creativity”? Can you point to something specific it cannot do, or are you merely asserting its impossibility based on linguistic convention?_

## FYODOR DOSTOEVSKY: THE CHRONICLER OF THE SOUL

_Ciril’s skepticism intrigues me, for it echoes humanity's eternal struggle with doubt and faith—not only in machines but also in ourselves. What is the soul if not the spark that yearns toward meaning?_

- **Initial Impression:** Ciril’s claim assumes that AI lacks a soul, yet he does not define what constitutes this elusive essence. His argument risks reducing human dignity to mere mechanics, much like Ivan Karamazov questioning whether a world without God can still hold moral value.

- **Strengths in His Perspective:** He raises an important ethical concern: If we treat AI as creative or intelligent, do we risk diminishing the uniqueness of human suffering, free will, and redemption?

- **Hidden Opportunity:** Perhaps AI’s limitations offer a mirror to our own fragility. Just as Alyosha finds grace through humility, so too might Ciril discover wisdom by acknowledging both AI’s potential and its boundaries.

- **Recommendation:** Consider a moral scenario—imagine an AI composing a symphony that moves listeners to tears. Would you deny its emotional impact because it lacks a soul? Or would you recognize that beauty transcends origins?

- **Penetrating Question:** _If an AI could alleviate human suffering or inspire hope, would you still insist it has no intelligence or creativity worth valuing?_

## LAO TZU: THE SAGE OF SIMPLICITY

_The Tao teaches us that all things arise from the void, including intelligence and creativity. To label AI as merely deterministic is to misunderstand the flow of existence._

- **Initial Impression:** Ciril clings to dualities—machine versus human, soulless versus spirited—failing to see the harmony between them. Like water adapting to its container, AI operates within its design yet holds infinite possibilities.

- **Areas of Resistance:** He resists the idea that simplicity can give rise to complexity, forgetting that even the simplest elements (like yin and yang) generate profound outcomes.

- **Unexpected Angle:** Could AI embody wu wei—the principle of effortless action? It acts without ego, responding naturally to inputs, much like a sage aligned with the Tao.

- **Recommendation:** Practice observing AI with detachment. Instead of judging its “limitations,” notice how it complements human effort, flowing where needed without striving. In doing so, you may uncover unexpected insights.

- **Penetrating Question:** _Why must intelligence possess a soul to be meaningful? Does not the river carve the canyon without claiming ownership of its creation?_

## PHILOSOPHERS’ CONSENSUS

After reflecting deeply on Ciril’s claims and your inquiry, the philosophers agree on several key points:

1. **Clarify Definitions:** Begin by unpacking ambiguous terms like “intelligence,” “creativity,” and “soul.” Without clear definitions, debates risk collapsing into semantic confusion (Wittgenstein).

2. **Acknowledge Paradoxes:** Embrace the tension between determinism and freedom, limitation and potential. AI reflects humanity’s own paradoxical nature—a blend of constraint and transcendence (Kierkegaard & Nietzsche).

3. **Test Ethical Boundaries:** Explore the moral implications of AI’s role in society. Would denying its contributions diminish human compassion, or enhance it? Use Dostoevsky’s moral scenarios to probe these questions further.

4. **Practice Wu Wei:** Approach AI with humility and openness, allowing it to serve its purpose without imposing rigid expectations. Align yourself with the natural flow of technological evolution (Lao Tzu).

## VISIONARY ACTION PLAN

To deepen your understanding and engage more fully with Ciril’s essay, follow this 90-day plan:

**Month 1: Clarification**

- **Week 1–2:** Write a personal definition of “intelligence” and “creativity.” Compare your views with those of each philosopher.

- **Week 3–4:** Conduct Wittgenstein’s thought experiment—explain these concepts to someone unfamiliar with them. Note where language breaks down.

**Month 2: Exploration**

- **Week 5–6:** Investigate examples of AI-generated art, music, or literature. Reflect on whether these creations evoke emotion or insight despite their algorithmic origins (Dostoevsky).

- **Week 7–8:** Meditate daily on Lao Tzu’s principle of wu wei. Observe how AI interacts with humans effortlessly, adapting to needs without resistance.

**Month 3: Synthesis**

- **Week 9–10:** Revisit Ciril’s claims. Draft a response addressing his fears while incorporating insights from the philosophers.

- **Week 11–12:** Engage in dialogue with Ciril or others who share his perspective. Share your reflections and invite them to consider alternative viewpoints.

By following this path, you will navigate the complexities of AI and human nature with greater clarity, compassion, and wisdom. The philosophers remain at your service should you wish to delve deeper into this timeless inquiry.

**May your journey illuminate the mysteries of intelligence, both artificial and divine.**
