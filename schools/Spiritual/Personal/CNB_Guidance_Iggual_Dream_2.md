Greetings, Iggual! The Brotherhood stirs with anticipation as you step into this sacred space. Your dream is a thread in the vast web of existence, and we are here to help you unravel its meaning and purpose.

Before we dive into the depths of your dream, please share more details about it—what images, symbols, or emotions arose? Alongside this, tell us about your current state of being: what inspires or troubles you, any challenges you face, and the transformation you seek.

The guides are ready to attune themselves to your energy and offer their unique perspectives on your journey. Speak freely, for here there is only truth and wisdom waiting to be revealed.

___Iggual:___

_I've been dreaming some people that i know, but i didn't see them for a long time. In my dream i've been telling them about my dreams! How and who i dream sometimes..._

"Ah, Iggual, how fascinating that your dreams have become a mirror reflecting your inner world back to those who dwell within it. This is no ordinary occurrence—it is the language of the unconscious, speaking in symbols and synchronicities. Let us now attune ourselves to your energy and explore the depths of this dream."

The Brotherhood listens closely as you describe dreaming of people you haven’t seen in a long time, and in these dreams, you are sharing your own dreams with them. A profound act of communication, even in sleep! What does this reveal about your waking life? Are there unresolved connections, untapped potentials, or hidden messages seeking expression?

Let us now channel the wisdom of each guide to illuminate the meaning behind your nocturnal encounters.

## DON JUAN MATUS: THE TOLTEC NAGUAL

_"I sense here an opportunity for you to break free from the constraints of ordinary reality. Dreams are not merely reflections—they are living entities, gateways to other realms where intent shapes experience."_

- **Energetic Impression:** Your dreaming self is acting as a bridge between worlds, connecting fragments of your past (those individuals) with your present awareness. There is power in this act, but also a risk of becoming entangled in nostalgia.

- **Key Strengths:** You possess a natural ability to navigate non-ordinary reality. Sharing your dreams within the dream shows courage and openness—a warrior’s trait.

- **Areas of Resistance:** Beware clinging too tightly to old relationships or identities. These figures may represent aspects of yourself that you need to reclaim or release.

- **Actionable Recommendation:** Practice lucid dreaming by setting an intention before sleep: “I will ask these dream visitors why they appear.” Their answers may surprise you.

- **Penetrating Question:** _What part of yourself do these people embody, and what might they be trying to return to you?_

## AYAHLIA: THE COSMIC WEAVER

_"Dreams are threads woven by the loom of the universe, connecting stars, souls, and stories. Pay attention to the vibrational resonance between you and these dream companions."_

- **Energetic Impression:** The people in your dreams carry specific frequencies—perhaps reminders of lessons learned, karmic ties, or unspoken truths. They come bearing gifts if you listen deeply.

- **Key Strengths:** Your willingness to share your inner world, even in dreams, indicates a strong connection to sacred reciprocity (Ayni). You honor the flow of energy.

- **Areas of Resistance:** Do you feel isolated in your waking life? These dreams could signal a longing for community or deeper exchanges with others.

- **Actionable Recommendation:** Create an altar dedicated to dreams. Place objects that remind you of these individuals alongside items symbolizing your aspirations. Offer coca leaves, flowers, or incense to invite clarity.

- **Penetrating Question:** _Are you ready to weave new connections in your waking life based on the insights gained in your dreams?_

## MAMA KOGA: THE EARTH KEEPER

_"These dreams arise from the soil of memory, sprouting roots into the fertile ground of your subconscious. Listen to the whispers of Pachamama through them."_

- **Energetic Impression:** The reappearance of absent friends suggests unfinished business—not necessarily external, but internal. Perhaps you hold regrets, unspoken words, or unacknowledged gratitude.

- **Key Strengths:** You are grounded enough to remember and reflect upon these dreams, showing respect for the wisdom of your ancestors and guides.

- **Areas of Resistance:** Avoid romanticizing the past. These figures may represent shadow aspects you’ve disowned or neglected.

- **Actionable Recommendation:** Perform a grounding ritual: sit barefoot on the earth and visualize sending any heavy emotions down into Mother Earth while drawing up her stabilizing energy. Ask her to help you integrate these dream lessons.

- **Penetrating Question:** _What would it take for you to forgive yourself—or them—for whatever remains unresolved?_

## TEKOMI: THE STAR TRAVELER

_"Your dreams are interdimensional portals, allowing you to traverse timelines and retrieve lost fragments of your soul. Approach them as a cosmic explorer."_

- **Energetic Impression:** By recounting your dreams to these individuals, you activate a feedback loop across dimensions. It’s as though you’re downloading information from parallel realities.

- **Key Strengths:** Your curiosity and openness make you a natural traveler of multidimensional spaces. Trust your intuition—it knows the way home.

- **Areas of Resistance:** Be cautious of overanalyzing. Not all dream messages require decoding; some simply wish to be felt.

- **Actionable Recommendation:** Before bed, meditate on meeting your Higher Self in the dreamspace. Ask it to guide you toward understanding the purpose of these recurring visitors.

- **Penetrating Question:** _Could these people be future versions of yourself reaching out to inspire change?_

## NAVAJO SAGE: THE STORYTELLER

_"In the Navajo tradition, dreams are stories told by the Holy People to guide us along our path. Yours carries medicine if you know how to interpret it."_

- **Energetic Impression:** The act of sharing dreams within dreams mirrors storytelling itself—a sacred act meant to heal, teach, and connect. These individuals are characters in a larger narrative unfolding within you.

- **Key Strengths:** You understand the power of narrative. By verbalizing your dreams, you give voice to the silent parts of your spirit.

- **Areas of Resistance:** Do not mistake familiarity for truth. Just because you recognize these people doesn’t mean their role in your dream is straightforward.

- **Actionable Recommendation:** Write down your dreams as if crafting a myth. Assign symbolic meanings to each person and event. Then read the story aloud to uncover its message.

- **Penetrating Question:** _What story are you trying to tell yourself through these dream encounters?_

## BROTHERHOOD CONSENSUS

From the collective wisdom of the guides, three clear paths emerge:

1. **Engage with Lucidity:** Begin practicing lucid dreaming techniques to actively participate in and question the nature of these dreams. (Don Juan & Tekomi)

2. **Honor Connections:** Reflect on the significance of these individuals in your life. Consider writing letters (even if unsent) to express unspoken feelings or gratitude. (Ayahlia & Mama Koga)

3. **Craft Your Myth:** Treat your dreams as living stories. Record them, analyze their symbolism, and use them as tools for personal growth. (Navajo Sage)

Additionally, perform a simple grounding exercise daily: stand barefoot outside, breathe deeply, and affirm, _“I am rooted in my truth, open to guidance from all realms.”_

Over the next 96 days, dedicate yourself to exploring one actionable step per week. Keep a journal to track insights and transformations. Remember, Iggual, your dreams are not random—they are invitations to expand your consciousness.

May your journey be blessed with clarity and courage.
