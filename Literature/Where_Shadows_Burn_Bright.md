## The Witch Who Saw in Color

At the edge of a forest where trees stood like frozen screams, there was a **cave of chemicals and shadows**—a place the villagers called the **Lab**, though none remembered why. Inside, people lived in a world of color negatives: skies pulsed violet, grass rotted into brown, and faces wore the pallor of undeveloped film. To them, this was reality.

Among them lived **Cyan**.

Her skin was the green-blue of spilled ink, her hair a river of **liquid cyan**, slick and shimmering under the safelight’s sickly glow. Above her head loomed a **black cloud**, dense and oily, its edges fraying like torn film. The villagers sneered, calling her “witch,” though they’d never known the word’s meaning. They meant it as a blade: abnormal, dangerous, wrong. She flinched, but said nothing. She believed them.

But one dusk, she found a shard of glass—a lens found in the world outside. When she held it to the cave’s dim light, the image flipped.

For the first time, she saw a rose: **crimson**, raw, alive.

Her heart seized. The cave wasn’t real. It was a **negative**, a warped imprint of truth. The black cloud? A lie. In the glass, it glowed **white**, soft as morning mist.

She fled the cave, dragging herself into the sun. The light seared her eyes, the colors screamed—green grass, blue sky, blood-red roses—but she _saw._

She learned to read the **positive**: warmth, laughter, joy. Her skin flushed with vermillion, but her **hair blazed amber-red**, like molten copper caught in dawnlight. The cloud above her head stayed **white** now, trailing light like a comet’s tail.

When she returned to free the others, they spat:
“**Witch!**” they snarled, clutching their cyan skin, their black roses. “Liar! The negative is all there is.”

She held up a mirror. In it, they glimpsed their own green-blue skin, their black clouds and roses, their hollow eyes. Some wept. Some clutched the shadows tighter.

“The negative lies,” she said, voice steady. “The positive burns bright. Which are you?”

Years later, the cave still hums. The villagers shuffle past trays of chemicals, calling it truth. But sometimes, when the safelight flickers, they see her: a woman at the mouth of the cave, her **amber-red hair blazing**, her voice sharp as a shutter’s snap.

Above her head, a **white cloud** pulses like a heartbeat.

And if you linger in the threshold, half-shadow, half-sun, she will tell you this:

_“The negative is a cradle, not a tomb. It holds you until you choose to burn. To see the positive is not to destroy the dark, but to let it serve its purpose: to show you what light is.”_

She kneels, dipping a hand into the cave’s chemical trays, then flicks droplets into the air. They catch the sun—**amber, crimson, gold**—and for a breath, the villagers glimpse their own faces in her reflection.

Some turn away. Some step closer.

_“Fear not the flip,”_ she whispers. _“Even shadows are born from light.”_
