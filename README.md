# ðŸŽ“ The School Directory

Welcome to the **Schools** directory of the **Institute for Unconventional Genius (IUG)**! This directory houses all the schools, departments, and programs that make up the heart of IUG's chaotic yet brilliant ecosystem.

Each folder within this directory represents a unique school or department, complete with its own philosophy, courses, and traditions. Below is a quick guide to navigating this space:

---

## Structure

- **School Folders**: Each school has its own subdirectory containing:
  - `README.md`: Overview of the schoolâ€™s mission, motto, and offerings.
  - `Courses/`: A list of example courses offered by the school.
  - `Projects/`: Showcase of notable student projects or experiments.
  - `Traditions/`: Unique customs, events, or rituals associated with the school.
