- ***If i create a new directory inside existing, say /school/ with bash and not hugo, is this allowed or it somehow confuse Hugo?***

---

Yes! You can absolutely use Bash (or any method) to create directories inside your Hugo project — Hugo doesn't care how you create directories, as long as they follow its expected structure. Here's what works and what to avoid:

✅ Allowed: Manual Directory Creation. You can safely use Bash like:

mkdir -p content/school/new-subject
This creates a new section/sub-section structure that Hugo will recognize.

Required Structure for Hugo to Recognize Content
If you manually create directories inside content/, you must add an _index.md file to make Hugo treat it as a section:

touch content/school/new-subject/_index.md

Example _index.md:

```
---
title: "New Subject"
---
```

🔍 How Hugo Maps URLs
A directory like:

```
content/
└── school/
    └── new-subject/
        ├── _index.md
        └── lesson-1.md


Becomes:

/school/new-subject/      ← from _index.md
/school/new-subject/lesson-1/  ← from lesson-1.md


```
**⚠️ What Confuses Hugo**

**Directories outside content/, layouts/, or static/**

- Hugo ignores them unless explicitly referenced.
- Missing _index.md in new sections
- Hugo won’t generate section pages without it.
- Using Hugo-reserved directory names
- Avoid names like **themes, resources, or public** for your own content.

✅ Best Practices

Create new sections with:
```￼
mkdir -p content/section-name
touch content/section-name/_index.md
```
Add content pages with:
```
hugo new section-name/article.md
Use Hugo to generate section structure automatically:

hugo new school/new-subject/_index.md
```
---
**Final Check**

After creating directories:

Run hugo server to test
Check if new sections appear in menus (if linked)
Verify URLs work (e.g., /school/new-subject/)
Would you like me to:

Help debug a specific directory issue?
Add automation scripts for section creation?
Fix any broken section links caused by manual direc

- ***So that means that it translate: title: "New Subject" into /new-subject/ lowercase?***

---

Yes! Hugo automatically converts section/page titles and filenames into URL slugs using a predictable process. Here's how it works:

URL Slug Generation Rules
Hugo determines URLs based on this priority:

Front matter slug (highest priority)
Filename (if no slug is defined)
Title (only used if neither slug nor filename exist)
✅ Example: Filename → URL
If you create:


content/school/new-subject/_index.md
Hugo generates:


/school/new-subject/
Even if the file is named New Subject.md, Hugo:

Converts to lowercase: new subject.md → new-subject/
Replaces spaces/dashes consistently
✅ Example: Front Matter slug
If you define a slug in front matter:


---
title: "Advanced Topic"
slug: "custom-url-path"
---
Hugo generates:


/school/custom-url-path/
This overrides the filename-based URL.

✅ Example: Title vs. Filename

File	Front Matter	URL
content/school/My Topic.md	(no front matter)	/school/my-topic/
content/school/My Topic.md	title: "New Title"	/school/my-topic/
content/school/My Topic.md	title: "New Title", slug: "special"	/school/special/

Key Takeaways
Filenames control URLs by default
Use slug to override for custom paths
Titles don’t affect URLs directly
Case matters in filenames but Hugo often converts to lowercase

Final Check
Rename a file to test:
My Cool Page.md → /my-cool-page/
Add a slug:

slug: "awesome-topic"
→ /awesome-topic/
Would you like me to:

Help debug a specific URL issue?
Add automation for slug conversion?
Fix any mismatched URLs from manual directories?

- ***_index.md trick doesn't work for some reason. It doesn't list sub-dir /School/AI/ and it's content. What can be wrong? Some parameters, Tags? Uppercase/Lowecase issue? Mouse hower over top menu "School" show: ../school/ lowercase..***

---

Let's systematically debug why /school/ai/ isn't appearing in your Hugo site:

🔍 1. Verify Directory Structure
Ensure you have:

```
content/
└── school/
    ├── _index.md       # Section home page
    └── ai/
        ├── _index.md   # Sub-section home page
        └── lesson-1.md # Regular content page
```
        
Key Files Missing?

If _index.md is missing in /ai/, Hugo won't treat it as a section.

✅ 2. Check _index.md Front Matter
Make sure both _index.md files have at least:

```￼
---
title: "AI"
---

```

Optional: Add list: true (default) to ensure it appears in lists:

```
---
title: "AI"
list: true
---
```

🔤 3. Case Sensitivity in URLs
Hugo converts URLs to lowercase by default. This is normal:

content/School/AI/ → /school/ai/
content/school/ai/ → /school/ai/
But! Hugo is case-sensitive with file paths:

❌ content/School/ai/_index.md might not work on some OS/file systems
✅ content/school/ai/_index.md (use lowercase everywhere)
Fix: Rename all directories/files to lowercase:

mv content/School content/school
mv content/school/AI content/school/ai

4. Menu Configuration
Ensure your menu points to the correct URL:

```
[[menu.main]]
  name = "School"
  url = "/school/"
```
If you're using a custom menu template, verify it doesn't filter out subsections.

5. Section Visibility Settings
Check for these front matter parameters in _index.md:

```
---
draft: false         # Must be false to appear in production builds
list: true           # Default is true; false hides from lists
hide_in_lists: false # Some themes use custom params
---
```

6. Test with hugo server
Run with verbose logging:

￼
hugo server --verbose

Look for:

✅ INFO: Adding section school/ai/

❌ **WARN:** Page is **draft** and will **not be rendered.**

7. Clear Cache
Sometimes Hugo gets stuck:
```
hugo server --ignoreCache 
```
